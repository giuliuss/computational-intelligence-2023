## Practical example where Reinforcement Learning doesn't fit properly
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for solving a wide range of problems, but it does have limitations, and there are scenarios where it may not be the most suitable or effective method. One such example is in situations where the goal cannot be easily framed as the maximization of cumulative expected rewards. 

**Example: Self-driving Car Safety**

Consider a self-driving car that needs to navigate through a city. The traditional RL approach might involve rewarding the car for reaching its destination quickly and penalizing it for collisions or traffic violations. However, in the real world, safety is a critical concern, and it's not always straightforward to define safety in terms of a cumulative reward function.

In this scenario, the goal is to ensure the safety of the passengers and others on the road. Defining a reward function that accurately captures all aspects of safety (e.g., avoiding collisions, respecting traffic rules, anticipating and reacting to unexpected events) in a way that allows for effective learning is a complex challenge.

Additionally, in safety-critical systems, trial-and-error learning, which is inherent in many RL algorithms, may have severe consequences. A self-driving car cannot afford to learn the consequences of unsafe actions through real-world accidents.

This example highlights a scenario where the goal, ensuring safety, is not easily expressed as the maximization of cumulative expected rewards, making traditional RL approaches less suitable for the problem at hand.
